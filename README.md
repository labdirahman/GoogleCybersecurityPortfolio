# GoogleCybersecurityPortfolio
I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, a comprehensive program that equipped me with the essential skills to understand and implement cybersecurity practices in todayâ€™s evolving digital landscape. This program provided me with hands-on experience in protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access and cyberattacks, using tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. I also gained insights into identifying common risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, and learned effective strategies for mitigating them. Additionally, I developed practical skills in Python, Linux, and SQL. The program offered a blend of instructional videos, labs, quizzes, and study materials, which prepared me for entry-level roles in cybersecurity. 

My training focused on the following key areas:

**Cybersecurity Fundamentals:**  
I learned the foundational knowledge and skills required for a cybersecurity analyst, including how security incidents can impact business operations. The course also covered key tools and security practices used by professionals in the field. The topics included cloud networks, network security, security hardening, network architecture, and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

**Managing Security Risks:**  
This course taught me to identify common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that can compromise business operations. I explored how organizations utilize security frameworks and controls, including how to use playbooks for responding to security incidents. I developed expertise in security audits, incident response, and frameworks such as the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

**Networks and Network Security:**  
I gained a deep understanding of network components and how data flows within a network. I also learned techniques to secure networks against intrusions and enhance system hardening. Key skills developed included using command-line interfaces (CLI) and Bash.

**Linux and SQL:**  
In this section, I explored the relationship between operating systems, applications, and hardware. I learned to navigate and manage file systems through the Bash shell and used SQL to interact with databases. This section helped me build my skills in Linux and SQL.

**Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities:**  
I learned how to classify and analyze assets, identify risks through attack surface analysis, and recognize common threats such as social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits. This course also emphasized threat modeling and risk mitigation techniques, with a focus on vulnerability assessment, authentication, cryptography, and stakeholder communication.

**Detection and Response:**  
This course taught me the processes involved in incident detection and response, including containment, eradication, and recovery. I also learned to analyze network traffic and use intrusion detection systems like Suricata and Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) tools. I became proficient in investigating security events using SIEM tools such as Splunk and Chronicle.

**Automating Cybersecurity Tasks with Python:**  
I learned how Python is applied in cybersecurity for automating tasks, including creating user-defined functions, using regular expressions for data extraction, and debugging code. This section enhanced my skills in Python programming and cybersecurity automation.

**Preparing for Cybersecurity Jobs:**  
I also received training on how to navigate the cybersecurity job market, including when and how to escalate security incidents, how to network within the cybersecurity community, and how to prepare for job interviews.

This portfolio, along with others that will follow, showcases my dedication to mastering cybersecurity at an expert level. I am committed to continuously developing my skills to meet the growing demands of the industry, as technology advances and cyber threats evolve. I am eager to undergo any further training required to excel in any cybersecurity role I am offered.
